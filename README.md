Summary:
The aim of the project was to develop a management desktop application for a police station. The system must be able to process all the reports (created by the police or citizens) and criminal records, as well as to manage the inventory of the station and the workers' planning.
The system was developed following the RUP methodology. We used .NET 4.5.1 as framework along with Visual Studio 2013 and C# language. The project covered these topics:
- UI: WPF.
- Database: Entity Framework and LinQ
- Web Service (Connection to the DB in the server): WCF
- Testing: Unit and functional tests (UI Tests) with Visual Studio Testing environment.
- Version Control: Microsoft TFS
